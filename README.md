This project involves creating a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to develop a functional calculator that can perform essential arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Project Objectives:

    Learn and Apply HTML: Structure the calculator interface using HTML.
    Style with CSS: Use CSS to design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
    Implement Functionality with JavaScript: Write JavaScript code to handle the arithmetic operations and update the calculator display based on user input.

Task Breakdown:

    HTML Structure:
        Create a container for the calculator.
        Add display elements to show the current input and result.
        Add buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), clear function (C), and equals (=).

    CSS Styling:
        Style the calculator container to center it on the page.
        Style the display area to show the input and results clearly.
        Style the buttons to be easily clickable and visually distinct.

    JavaScript Functionality:
        Implement event listeners for button clicks.
        Create functions to handle the different arithmetic operations.
        Update the display based on user input and operations performed.
        Implement a clear function to reset the calculator
